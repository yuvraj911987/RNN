# RNN
Text classification tasks 

Here i am doing sentiment analysis on IMDB movie review dataset with 50,000 entries using Tensorflow2.0 with Keras. 
I have created several models and covered wide variety of topics here - 
1. Sentiment Analysis using single LSTM layer
2. Sentiment Analysis using multiple LSTM layers
3. Sentiment Analysis using simple RNN layers
4. Sentiment Analysis using Pre Trained word embeddings
5. Sentiment Analysis using word embeddings on-the-fly
6. Sentiment Analysis using CNN for Text classifications
7. Sentiment Analysis using CNN plus LSTM layers for Text classifications
8. How to save a deep learning model 
9. Transfer learning on smaller text dataset (30 movie reviews)
10. Text Generation using both LSTM and statistical methods
11. Comparing statistical and deep learning text generation model performances using BLEU scores.
